This project is a failed attempt at inheritance.
The base class is Animal.
The sub classes are Duck and Dog.
A requirement of this exercise is to use a factory to instantiate 
the Duck and Dog class using characyer codes 'a' and 'b'.
The main class should produce the following output:
"Quack Quck" and "Woof Woof" put produces "Animal Sound...Animal Sound...".

How do I fix this?  Thanks.
